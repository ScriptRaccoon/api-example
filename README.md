# API Example

This is an illustration of how to use APIs (application programming interfaces).

Specifically, the API of The Movie Database (TMDB) is used to search for actors by a name, and then to search for all movies in which an actor has played.

In order for this to work, you need to get a key for the TMDB API and add it in api.js.

These ideas have been expanded in a bigger project 'Actors Info' which is available at
